# Project Description

Aim:  
To identify geographical coordinates of all hydro and wind stations in New Zealand.

Method:  
The fuel_gen data contains a list of power stations in NZ and their fuel generation type.
The nsp_info data contains a list of POCs and their coordinates.

We need to:  

- Access fuel_gen data and make a list of all hydro and wind stations in New Zealand, along with their POC code.
- Use the POC codes from step 1. to find the respective coordinates in nsp_info file.
